_The female artists and designers - Lola van Praag, Mae Engelgeer, Beppe Kessler, Joana Schneider and Kiki van Eijk - share a fascination for textiles in all kinds of colors, materials and shapes._

_With ‘SOFT!’, Pien Rademakers weaves a layered red thread in responds to the zeitgeist - and the great need for tactility._

In the last one and a half years Covid has made traveling very difficult. Every now and then - in order to escape the city - I visited my parents, who live in the flower bulb region. When the tulip season arrived and the promise of the vaccins slowly became a reality I got inspired. I translated my newfound love for the flower bulb region into a series of drawings, which I - together with the people from the TextielLab Tilburg - made into fabric. The Textile Museum in Tilburg gave me the opportunity to work on the industrial knitting machine. Normally these machines are used to create fabrics for furniture or t-shirts. For this project I've tried to find new ways to use these industrial machines. All the designs exist of several different layers. This gave me the opportunity to play with texture and 3D-effects. Besides that I used several different types of yarn which I switched manually in order to circumvent the maximum amount of colors these machines are normally capable of. An unorthodox method of making autonomous work with this industrial machine, combining the manual with the mechanical.
